HUMAN LEVEL PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT

This is the log of a human level performance measurement on the intent classification task.
- dataset: hugging-face silicone maptask

The experiment was done by guessing 24 labels for 24 utterances by only using for reference 3 labelled examples per label.

The human accuracy is at 54.1% (13/24)

This sets a baseline performance and highlights challenges when predicting these labels: some labels are very similar
- "right" can be ready but can also be acknowledge or reply_y which highlights intersection between labels
- clarify ("right down there") and check ("right beside it") can be confused without punctuation


Here is the reference used:

acknowledge:
    uh-huh
    okay
    right okay oops that was
